# Multiple-Linear-Regression
I have created a multiple regression model on '50-Startups' dataset. In the dataset there were 4 predictors (1 Categorical and 3 numerical) and one target. Splitting the data into 80:20 train-test split this model was built to predict the value of the profit of the startups

1. Initially we trained the model mentioned above where profit is the target/ output variable
2. Then I created a web app using flask
3. Committed the code in github
4. Then I created an account in Heroku (Platform As A Service)
5. Link the Github with Heroku
6. Deploy the model
7. Webapp is ready
